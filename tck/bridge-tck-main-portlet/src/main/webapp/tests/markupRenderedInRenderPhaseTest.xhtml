		This view is used by chapter5_2Tests-markupRenderedInRenderPhaseTest-portlet simply for the sake of having a
		view rendered that contains some component markup. The test verifies that the JSF lifecycle (including the
		RENDER_RESPONSE phase) is executed in the HEADER_PHASE of the Portlet 3.0 lifecycle rather than the
		RENDER_PHASE of the Portlet 1.0/2.0 lifecycle. It also verifies that markup is captured by the bridge during
		the HEADER_PHASE and then written to the response during the RENDER_PHASE. Since the test suppresses the
		actual writing of the view's markup to the response, it will not appear in the browser. Instead,
		MarkupRenderedInRenderPhasePortlet.render(RenderRequest,RenderResponse) will write out the test results
		directly to the response.
