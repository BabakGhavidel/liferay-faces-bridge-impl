bridge-inputfile=[javadoc:com.liferay.faces.bridge.component.inputfile.InputFile] is a [javadoc:javax.faces.component.UIInput] component that renders an `&lt;input&gt;` element with `type="file"`. Since it extends [javadoc:javax.faces.component.html.HtmlInputFile], it supports all the features of [vdldoc:h:inputFile] and also supports multi-file uploads.
bridge-inputfile-general=By default, one file can be uploaded as a non-Ajax (full-page) postback.
bridge-inputfile-instant-ajax=Files can be uploaded *instantly* via Ajax by adding an [vdldoc:f:ajax] child tag.
bridge-inputfile-multiple=Multi-file upload is supported by setting the HTML5 passthrough attribute [vdldoc:alloy:inputFile:multiple]=`multiple`.
bridge-inputfile-portlet-only=The [vdldoc:bridge:inputFile] component is a *legacy* feature of Liferay Faces Bridge. Although it has the benefit of supporting *multi-file uploads*, it only works in a *portlet environment* (not in a webapp environment).

the-enclosing-form-must-have-multipart-form-data=The enclosing form must have `enctype="multipart/form-data"`
